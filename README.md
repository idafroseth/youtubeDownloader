# YouTube Crawler
This tool is a result of a student project. The tool quickly and efficient downloads a large dataset of metadata from youtube. I can also download the actual video file, but be aware that this would take a lot of time, and are against YouTube policy. The goal of this dataset is to use it in multimodal analysis.
